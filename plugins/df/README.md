# df

Development flow — workflow automation for individual developers. Runs on both Claude Code and Codex CLI.

## Overview

This plugin provides a structured workflow for feature development:

```
research → planning → [iterate] → implement → [validate] → [peer-review] → commit → [handoff]
```

Steps in brackets `[]` are optional. Each step is a skill invoked explicitly (only `commit` auto-triggers on intent; the rest are manual-only):

- **Claude Code**: `/df:<name>` (e.g. `/df:research`).
- **Codex CLI**: `$df:<name>` or `$<name>` (e.g. `$df:research`). The Claude-style `/df:<name>` slash is **not** a valid Codex command.

**Naming**: skills are namespaced as `df:<name>` on Claude Code (`/df:planning`) and on Codex CLI (`$df:planning` or `$<name>`). Always use the namespaced form — the unprefixed `/research`, etc. are not provided by this plugin and may resolve to something else (a personal skill, a bundled command, another plugin) in your environment.

## Skills

All workflow surfaces are skills (no slash commands). Only `commit` auto-triggers on description matches in both runtimes; the other eight are manual-only (`disable-model-invocation: true` on Claude Code, `allow_implicit_invocation: false` on Codex) and run only when you invoke them explicitly.

| Skill                 | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `df:research`         | Comprehensive codebase research with parallel sub-agents                                       |
| `df:planning`         | Create detailed implementation plans with thorough research                                    |
| `df:iterate`          | Update existing plans based on feedback                                                        |
| `df:implement`        | Execute plans with verification and phase-by-phase progress                                    |

| `df:validate`         | Verify implementation against plan, identify issues                                            |
| `df:peer-review`      | Independent two-stage (spec + quality) code review by an isolated reviewer                     |
| `df:handoff`          | Create handoff document for session transfer                                                   |

## Subagents

| Agent                     | Description                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `codebase-locator`        | Find files by topic/feature                   |
| `codebase-analyzer`       | Understand implementation details             |
| `codebase-pattern-finder` | Find similar patterns and examples            |
| `thoughts-locator`        | Discover documents in thoughts/ directory     |
| `thoughts-analyzer`       | Extract insights from thought documents       |
| `web-search-researcher`   | Research modern web information               |
| `code-reviewer`           | Independent, isolated two-stage code reviewer |

**Claude Code**: Subagents are auto-discovered from `plugins/df/agents/*.md` when the plugin is installed.

**Codex CLI**: Codex plugins cannot bundle subagents; the canonical TOML versions live at `plugins/df/codex/agents/*.toml`. After installing the plugin, run the **required** install helper once to copy them into `~/.codex/agents/`:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fokkoru/ai-foo/main/scripts/install-codex-agents.sh)
# …or, from a local clone:  bash scripts/install-codex-agents.sh
```

This step is required, not optional — without it `research`/`planning`/`iterate` fail with "agent not found". The `web-search-researcher` Codex agent additionally requires `web_search` enabled in `~/.codex/config.toml` under `[tools]`.

## Customize paths (optional)

Skills use these default paths:

- Research documents: `thoughts/research`
- Implementation plans: `thoughts/plans`
- Handoffs: `thoughts/handoffs`

To override, add a one-line note to your project's `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md` for Codex), for example: `df: write plans to docs/plans`. Claude Code and Codex CLI pick this up automatically because `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` is always in context — no env vars or skill edits needed.

## Installation

See the root [`README.md`](../../README.md) of `fokkoru/ai-foo` for canonical install instructions for both Claude Code and Codex CLI.

Brief recap:

- **Claude Code** loads the plugin from `plugins/df/` automatically once the marketplace has been registered against `fokkoru/ai-foo` (see the root README for the exact command).
- **Codex CLI**, in three steps: `codex plugin marketplace add fokkoru/ai-foo` → `codex plugin add df@ai-foo` → run `install-codex-agents.sh` (the required subagent step above). Opening the repo directly with `cd ai-foo && codex` auto-discovers the marketplace from `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` as a dev-only shortcut, but the subagent step is still required.

### As Project-Local Files (Claude Code only)

Copy skills and agents directly into your project's `.claude/` directory:

```bash
cp -r df/skills your-project/.claude/skills/df
cp -r df/agents your-project/.claude/agents
```

Note: Project-local installation embeds the skills and agents in your repository. Plugin installation keeps them external.

## Tool gating differences

The `allowed-tools` declarations inside each `SKILL.md` are honored by Claude Code as a per-skill pre-approval list. Codex CLI ignores this field and falls back to session-level approval prompts — Codex users will see more "approve this tool call?" prompts than Claude users for the same skill. This is a UX difference, not a security issue.

## Reasoning effort

Some skills use the `ultrathink` keyword to nudge for deeper reasoning. On Opus 4.7 this only adds a weak in-context hint — it no longer changes the effort level sent to the API. To actually control reasoning depth, use the real levers:

- **Claude Code**: `/effort` (session), `--effort` (flag), or `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` (env). Opus 4.7 defaults to `xhigh`.
- **Codex CLI**: `model_reasoning_effort` in `~/.codex/config.toml`.

## Usage Examples

### Research the codebase

```
/df:research How does authentication work in this project?     # Claude
$df:research How does authentication work in this project?     # Codex
```

### Create an implementation plan

```
/df:planning Add rate limiting to the API     # Claude
$df:planning Add rate limiting to the API     # Codex
```

### Execute a plan

```
/df:implement thoughts/plans/2024-01-15_rate-limiting.md     # Claude
$df:implement thoughts/plans/2024-01-15_rate-limiting.md     # Codex
```

### Independent code review

```
/df:peer-review thoughts/plans/2024-01-15_rate-limiting.md     # Claude
$df:peer-review thoughts/plans/2024-01-15_rate-limiting.md     # Codex
```

### Commit changes

```
> commit these changes  (auto-triggers df:commit)
```

## Workflow

1. **Research**: Understand the codebase and existing patterns
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed, phased implementation plan
3. **Iterate**: Adjust the plan based on findings
4. **Implement**: Execute the plan phase by phase with verification
5. **Validate**: Verify implementation against plan, identify issues
6. **Review**: Independent, isolated two-stage code review (spec compliance, then code quality)
7. **Commit**: Create logical, well-organized commits
